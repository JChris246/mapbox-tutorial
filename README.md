# Getting Started with Mapbox-GL v2 and Create React App

## To do
1. When user clicks on map, display a popup that prompts the user to save the coordinates (lat & lng) with a title. Once saved (to localstorage), add the marker to the map at the coordinates
2. Display a list of saved markers next to the map (show only title)
3. When user clicks on one of the saved markers, zoom in on the displayed marker on the map (increase zoom level to 14)
4. For each of the saved markers in the list, allow user to click a 'delete' button to remove it from the list and from localstorage


## Note
1. No additional npm packages are allowed
2. Create the popup using React Portals or plain CSS
